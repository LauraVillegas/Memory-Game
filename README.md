In a medial temporal lobe not so far away...\
There is a region called the limbic system, in which our heroes the hippocampus, the cingulate gyrus, the hypothalamus, the amygdala, the epithalamus and the mammillary body *(did you memorized that?)* work relentlessly to keep your memory working sharp and with it, the balance in your universe.\
Give your heroes a hand by working out your memory with this fun game.
